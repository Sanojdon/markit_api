# markit_api
This web application, showing how the stock exchange works. There are two APIs used, namely Markit API and Alphavantage
For live market feeds, we use Alphavantagee API, so that you can see the last values of the stock that you have bought. The stocks you buy are saved into the database.
Markit API is used for getting the quote and price of the stock. You will be able to buy stocks of the companies provided by Markit API
The frontend has been created using Bootstrap 4.
The project is made in Flask Framework, hence there was a lot of flexibility in changing and altering the views and models.
Flask SQLAlchemy is used for database connectivity, and for further backend programming.
The database used is SQLite3

Enjoy the game!!!!!!
